/// incoming messages). Components that implement this interface should advise the pipeline when they are done posting
/// messages via the <c>notifyCompletionTime</c> action delegate that is supplied when the pipeline calls the
/// <see cref="Start"/> method. This delegate may be saved and invoked later once the pipeline completion time is known,
/// or in the case of components that do not have the concept of "completion" (i.e. infinite sources), it may be invoked
/// immediately with a completion time of <see cref="DateTime.MaxValue"/>. Reactive components that generate messages only
